ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW
This assignment evaluates your ability to design and build scalable backend systems with a strong
focus on API design, security, performance, and real-time communication.
You are expected to approach this as a production-grade backend service, not a demo.
Problem Statement
Build a Real-Time Collaborative Workspace Backend
Design and implement a backend service that powers a real-time collaborative workspace for
developers (similar to a simplified collaborative coding platform).
The system should support:
• Secure authentication
• Project & workspace management
• Real-time collaboration events
• Asynchronous job processing
• Cloud-ready, scalable architecture
Purple Merit Technologies
Functional Requirements:
1. Authentication & Authorization
• JWT or OAuth2-based authentication
• Role-based access control:
o Owner
o Collaborator
o Viewer
• Token refresh mechanism
• API rate limiting
2. Project & Workspace APIs
Implement RESTful APIs to:
• Create, update, delete projects
• Manage workspaces
• Invite collaborators
• Assign and update user roles
Expectations:
• API-first design
• Proper HTTP status codes
• OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
3. Real-Time Collaboration
• WebSocket-based communication
• Broadcast events such as:
o User join/leave
Purple Merit Technologies
o File change events (mocked payloads)
o Activity or cursor updates
• Event distribution using:
o Redis Pub/Sub or
o Kafka / RabbitMQ / AWS SQS
4. Asynchronous Job Processing
Simulate a code execution or background task system:
• Accept job requests via API
• Push jobs to a message queue
• Background worker processes jobs
• Persist job results and status
Must include:
• Retry logic
• Failure handling
• Idempotent job processing
5. Data Storage
Use multiple data stores:
• Relational DB: PostgreSQL or MySQL
• Non-relational DB: MongoDB and/or Redis
Key considerations:
• Proper schema design
• Indexing
• Data integrity

Non-Functional Requirements
Performance & Scalability
• Redis caching
• Horizontally scalable design
• Async/non-blocking I/O where applicable
Testing
• Unit tests for core business logic
• Integration tests for APIs and auth flows
• Meaningful test coverage (≈70%)
Deployment & DevOps
• Dockerized services
• One of:
o Docker Compose or
o Kubernetes manifests
• CI/CD pipeline:
o Lint
o Test
o Build
Security
• Input validation
• Protection against SQL/NoSQL injection
• Secure secrets via environment variables
• Proper CORS configuration
• Serverless function usage
Purple Merit Technologies
• Observability (logging + metrics)
• Feature flags
• Clean Architecture / DDD patterns
• API versioning strategy
Submission Requirements
Deliverables
1. Git repository (public or private link)
2. README.md including:
o Architecture overview (diagram optional)
o Setup & run instructions
o Design decisions and trade-offs
o Scalability considerations
3. API documentation
4. Test instructions
5. Deployment instructions
Time Constraint & Submission

• Submit:
1. GitHub Repo Link
2. Live Deployment Links
3. Walkthrough Video Link
• Late submissions will be disqualified.
We look forward to reviewing your comprehensive approach. Best of luck!
